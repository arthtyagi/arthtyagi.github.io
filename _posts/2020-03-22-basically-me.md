This blog post is essentially an extended "About" section with some more context on what I actually do and why I do that so that should be interesting? Or maybe not if you're not into that stuff and still stumbled upon this. Either way, I'll continue. The good thing about writing on my own website is, I just whatever the f comes to mind cause duh idc who's reading this. Also, it's mostly stuff I just write without pauses or second thoughts, plain verbose thinking through magnificent words ( nah, not really magnificent tho, for magnificent writing xD you should probably check out my other articles and blog posts on Hackernoon and shit ).

Coding is not a child's play but in a way it is, it constitutes a lot of factors. Anyway, I'll just be honest here and now that I think of it, I would rather start by telling you about who and what I got influenced from. This basically includes all the stuff that has impacted me, btw I'll do a post on ArchLinux and probably how COVID-19 is probably a catastrophe all over the world I actually witnessed and how brutally it has affected all of us except you already know that so I'd do something regarding what I'm doing during that time cause well yeah, I started a new project, I'm pretty sure that I'd be able to build the MVP of this all by myself, will use Django for the Backend and hack the frontend using Bootstrap but that's not the point here, this post was about talking about my influences, right? So yeah, we'll do that. Woah this gives me an idea of doing a weird FAQ thing for myself no one really asked for but that'd be fun too and with a lot of time on my hands as of now ( which I'm trying to spend mostly on my projects, brainstorming, doing studies a bit and well yeah staying on my screen watching some shit on YouTube, I try not to though ), it's a real possibility that I might end up doing that or not. Hopefully, not.

Mark Zuckerberg btw has definitely influenced me a LOT. More than I thought actually. I first came to know about him when I was 7, his biopic just released and I looked that up on the internet and well that's how I came to know who this guy was. I've actually watched 'The Social Network' like 50+ times easily and I can't seem to get enough of it, idk what's about that movie that just gives me motivation spikes somehow and I just get too much into it. 
I was influenced to the point that me and my friend decided to build our own Facemash for fun the night I watched it again and pitched my idea to him. I face-timed him and he started to fetch the pictures while I wrote the simple Flask backend, the front-end was literally just an HTML and a CSS file, I know it sounds really bad and is probably a violation of privacy but well I built it in less than an hour so that's a silver lining right there. We stayed up till 5am though cause I won't stop talking about how the whole deployment is giving the ERROR 500 which I eventually resolved. In a nutshell, he has inspired and influenced me a lot.

</div> Anyone who knows me personally knows pretty well that I'm an Elon fanboy so there's that. He has influenced me way more than anyone to be honest, I researched a LOT on him, I basically studied him when I was 15. Ik that sounds nutty but it's not, it's real lol. The way he has made an entire empire for himself is worthy of appreciation, he started as South African boy who used to get bullied to one of the most ( probably the most ) influential and disrupting figures of the 21st century.

Some of the other influences include Steve Jobs whom I admire for his marketing skills, the way he just did things was simply articulate and eloquent. And then there's George Hotz, the first person to ever unlock the iPhone who's now working on self driving cars.

Music is also a pretty important aspect of our lives I suppose and well the books we read or maybe the stuff we watch.

</div> Pink Floyd, Arctic Monkeys, Eminem and Queen just seem to be pleasing to both my spirit and my ear. I do listen to Travis too, the beats are pretty sick.

Recently I made an AI music generator using dense networks so yeah, music is pretty great lol.

Silicon Valley and Breaking Bad are definitely the best TV Shows **in my opinion**.

Movies? Pulp Fiction, Donnie Darko, The Social Network, The Wolf of Wall Street and...hmm Shutter Island? Idk.

By this point I don't see what this post is all about, it felt like a compilation of some of the stuff I admired.

How about I list my technology stack down to make it a little better? Will do a post on the machines I use sometime later when I get a chance, would mostly be doing blogs about the stuff I do, installed ArchLinux a while ago on HyperV, that felt good, had never used Arch before seriously but well now I certainly do like it, not as a main OS though.

My technology stack is pretty varied actually :
- Python3, Java, JS, Assembly, C#, Ruby, Rust. ( In descending order of proficiency) 
- Django ( for large applications ) and Flask ( for weekend projects and smaller applications)
- Machine Learning using Scikit-Learn, yes I do Data Visualization before proceeding. Still trying to be good at TensorFlow.
- Android Development using Java

That's pretty much it for this one, will update on the project and probably blog something once in a while. Kind of like talking to myself except not really.
