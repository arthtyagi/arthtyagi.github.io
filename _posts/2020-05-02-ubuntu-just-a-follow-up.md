Hey, there. Obviously I didn't post the blog posts on stuff like installing Arch Linux like I said I would but well then again, it's not like this is what I do the whole time plus at this point I'm not accountable to anyone cause well, not a lot of people are reading these blogs, I'm just doing this to keep a track of what I was thinking and working with in the past and at the same time I thought I could just back that all up online, so I just ended up doing this. 

Either way, I'm thinking I'll just align more to posts regarding the technical stuff in the future instead of personal stuff, there already has been enough of it, I suppose. 

I'm still working on Domecode btw, just putting it on hold for the next two weeks, my AP and a hackathon is coming up so I need to brush up on those skills.
