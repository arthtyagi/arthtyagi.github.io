JQuery's Ajax is a really effective way of reducing the number of page reloads through a combination of technologies that are integrated together. 
You can call a python function (directly from your template) in the ajax.py file under the project's app directory without config a specific URL for it.
According to Dajax's documentation,
Dajax is a powerful tool to easily and super-quickly develop asynchronous presentation logic in web applications, using Python and almost no JavaScript source code.

It supports four of the most popular JavaScript frameworks: Prototype, jQuery, Dojo and mootols.

Using django-dajaxice as communication core, Dajax implements an abstraction layer between presentation logic managed with JavaScript and your Python business logic.

With Dajax you can modify your DOM structure directly from Python.

In all, if you are yearning for less JS code in your codebase, you should be trying out dajax, it's a really good third party library for using JQuery's Ajax in a Django back-end. Albeit, what matters is that the end client experience would be better when you are using either Ajax or Dajax.
