If I were compelled to be terse about myself, I'd say that :
I founded @arisveam at 16. I am a developer, blogger and ocassionally composing music for fun. Contributor for TorProject's Nyx. growing ðŸŒ³

However, as pauciloquent I try to be, I deem it better to define myself in a few more words cause who am I kidding? This is an "About Me" page. But I'll definitely try me best to be concise.

I started learning code when I was 11, wrote my first line of code at 6 though, a LOGO program, the one with the turtle if you get whatI mean. I started taking it seriously when I was 14, I got a little into ethical hacking, learnt spoofing, phishing and other social engineering techniques but a lot has happened since then.

I started out ~~working~~ experimenting with Machine Learning in November 2018 and in May 2019 finally made enough progress to start building simple products. Over the months, I built android applications, stock simulators and similar applications. Some of them are open-source. You can check my Github for it.

As of the time I'm writing this file in my vim, I'm working on a platform to help people to learn code. I'm building it using Django mainly along with other services but principally, Django powers it. I'm also actively working on the development Tor Project's python library,Nyx and learning Stem to build my own Tor Client. 

Apart from it, I'm interested in competitive programming a bit, got in the top 12% in the world in Google Hashcode 2020 earlier this year. Getting my feet a lil wet in CTFs too but I'm more of a noob with CTFs rn, still learning lol.

Gonna be setting up an Onion version of this website soon for the Dark Web cause I support internet rights! Always!

That's pretty much to it, and this is my tech stack. Last updated in April I guess, Idr tbh.

Well, you've reached the end :)
